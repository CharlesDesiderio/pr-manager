## FAQ

### Are you going to add support for custom sections?

Yes! This is next on my list, actually. But I wanted to get this published before I got too in the weeds with adding extras.

### These descriptions are kinda lame.

That's not a question, but yeah, I guess they are. But you're going to replace them with better content, right?

### Hey this is broken on mobile!

Also not a question, but mobile support is an upcoming feature.
